This repository contains SQL queries and business insights based on the Sakila sample database.

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries based on the Sakila sample database.
The goal is to practice SQL skills and show how the Sakila schema can be used to simulate an e-commerce environment.

## Queries
The queries focus on common business questions such as:
* Which products (films) generate the most revenue?
* Who are the top customers by total spending?
* What are the monthly revenue trends?
* Which categories are most profitable?
* What is the average order value?
* Which products were never rented (unsold inventory)?

  # Purpose
This project is part of my SQL learning journey and also a portfolio showcase.
It demonstrates how SQL can answer real e-commerce questions.

How to Use
1. Install the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).
2. Run queries from the `queries/` folder.
